## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

I should definitly focus more about responsiveness because I really struggled when I was working with the mobile device, also I noticed that I used many useless codes in css so i would like to improve the way I write my codes.
